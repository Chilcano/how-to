# API security checks

## Tools

1. [MegaLinter - Spectral Linter](https://megalinter.io/latest/descriptors/openapi_spectral)
  * It can be used from CLI, Docker and even as GitHub Actions
2. [Spectral Linter](https://github.com/stoplightio/spectral)
  * It can be used from CLI, Docker and even as GitHub Actions

> We are going to use Spectral CLI as NodeJS application because MegaLinter is too heavy (~3 mins) and when using Spectral GitHub Actions I had issues.

## Steps

### Spectral CLI

1. __Install NodeJS__

```sh
$ curl -fsSL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_16.x | sudo -E bash -
$ sudo apt-get install -y nodejs
$ node -v
v16.18.1

$ npm -v
8.19.2

$ sudo npm install npm@latest -g
```

2. __Install Spectral and Rulesets__

```sh
$ npm install @stoplight/spectral-cli
$ npm install @stoplight/spectral-owasp-ruleset
```
I'm going to create multiple config files to test different rulesets.
```sh
# ruleset was already installed when the linter was installed
$ echo 'extends: ["spectral:oas"]' > .spectral_oas.yaml

# ruleset had to be installed before with npm install
$ echo 'extends: ["@stoplight/spectral-owasp-ruleset"]' > .spectral_owasp.yaml

# ruleset is downloaded in runtime
$ echo 'extends: ["https://unpkg.com/@apisyouwonthate/style-guide@1.3.2/dist/ruleset.js"]' > .spectral_style_guide.yaml
```

3. __Run Spectral__

This allows preserving the exit when piping.
```sh
$ set -o pipefail
```

Printing stdout and stderr while piping to log file preserving the exit code at the same time.
```sh
$ mkdir -p _out/
$ npx spectral lint src/api_specs/openapi01.yaml -r .spectral_oas.yaml -v | tee _out/spectral_oas.log

```
This deactivate the `pipefail`.
```sh
$ set +o pipefail
```

This and next commands don't print stdout and stderr while piping to log file but It preservs the exit code.
```sh
$ npx spectral lint src/api_specs/openapi01.yaml -r .spectral_owasp.yaml -v > _out/spectral_owasp.log
$ npx spectral lint src/api_specs/openapi01.yaml -r .spectral_style_guide.yaml -v > _out/spectral_style_guide.log
```

### Spectral CLI in GitHub Actions
